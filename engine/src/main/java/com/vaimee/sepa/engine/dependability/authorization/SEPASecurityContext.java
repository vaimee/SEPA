Security context. Provides additional information necessary for processing a JOSE object.
Example context information:

Identifier of the message producer (e.g. OpenID Connect issuer) to retrieve its public key to verify the JWS signature.
Indicator whether the message was received over a secure channel (e.g. TLS/SSL) which is essential for processing unsecured (plain) JOSE objects.
