	<!-- ABSTRACT -->
	<section id="abstract">
		This document describes the <b>SPARQL Event Processing
			Architecture (SEPA)</b>. SEPA consists of the following components: the <i>SPARQL
			Secure Event (SE) Protocol Service</i> (also known as SEPA broker), the <a
			href="http://vaimee.org/TR/sparql11-se-protocol.html">SPARQL
			1.1 Secure Event (SE) Protocol</a> and the <a
			href="http://vaimee.org/TR/sparql11-subscribe.html">SPARQL
			1.1 Subscribe Language</a>. SEPA aims supporting the development of
		distributed, Web based and context aware applications, in particular
		with reference to <b>dynamic contexts</b> where detecting and reacting
		to events is critical. In such contexts, the use of SPARQL queries
		[[sparql11-query]] MAY be inefficient and MAY not guarantee to detect
		all the events because of their asynchronous nature. Furthermore, SEPA
		is built around a <b>security layer</b> (e.g.,TLS [[!RFC5246]]) and it
		allows <b>clients authentication</b> by means of JSON Web Tokens
		[[!RFC7519]]. Eventually, the publish-subscribe mechanism offered by
		SEPA MAY support <b>semantic driven coordination and discovery</b>. To
		increase software reuse and interoperability, SEPA also proposes an <b><a
			href="http://vaimee.org/TR/jsap.html">application design
				pattern</a></b> where each client can be categorized as producer, consumer
		or aggregator.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>In the Web of Data, a SPARQL protocol client can update and
			query a SPARQL endpoint using respectively the SPARQL 1.1 Update
			Language [[sparql11-update]] and the SPARQL 1.1 Query Language
			[[sparql11-query]]. Updates and queries can be conveyed through the
			SPARQL 1.1 protocol [[sparql11-protocol]].</p>

		<p>The development of applications over the Web of Data requires
			synchronization mechanisms that can be provided by SEPA. Thanks to
			the publish-subscribe mechanism implemented by a SEPA broker, clients
			can react to changes in the Web of Data and use such events to
			synchronize with other clients. The Web of Data becomes a Web of
			Dynamic Data. The default push based notification mechanism provided
			by a SEPA broker can also be complemented by a pull based one like
			for example the Linked Data Notifications [[ldn]] protocol.</p>

		<p>
			Furthermore, SEPA promotes the use of the <a
				href="http://vaimee.org/TR/jsap.html">JSON SPARQL
				Application Profile</a> to improve extesibility and interoperability of
			Dynamic Linked Data applications and services.

			A SEPA broker MUST implement the <a
				href="http://vaimee.org/TR/sparql11-se-protocol.html">SPARQL
				1.1 Secure Event (SE) Protocol</a> that is proposed as an extension of
			the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol [[sparql11-protocol]] to support subscribe
			primitives (i.e., <b>Subscribe</b>, <b>Unsubscribe</b>) and notifications (i.e., <b>Notify</b>). The SPARQL
			1.1 SE protocol is built around a <b>security layer</b> (e.g.,TLS
			[[!RFC5246]]) and it allows <b>client authentication</b> by means of
			JSON Web Tokens [[!RFC7519]]. The SEPA broker is built on top of a
			SPARQL Protocol Service [[sparql11-protocol]].

		<h2>SPARQL publish-subscribe</h2>
		<p>
			The SEPA broker implements a <b>content based publish-subscribe</b>
			mechanism where the content of events is expressed using the <i>SPARQL
				1.1 Query Language</i> [[sparql11-query]]. A SPARQL subscription acts as
			a persistent query: on every <i>SPARQL update</i>
			[[sparql11-update]], the query is evaluated and the results returned.
			Instead of returning all the results, the SEPA broker returns only
			changes in the results (i.e., <i>added and removed bindings
				results</i>). This allows saving network traffic (e.g., a relevant
			aspect in low rates network typical of Web of Things systems) and
			reducing processing cost on the client side (i.e., no need to compare
			previous results with the current ones to understand what is
			changed). Considering the previous results as the query results
			before the update and the current results as the query results after
			the update, the content of a notification includes the added and
			removed results as shown in the following figure:
		</p>

		<img src="media/addedremoved.jpg"
			title="The content of notifications: added and removed results"><br>
		<p>Fig. 2 - The content of notifications: added and removed
			results</p>

		<p>The publish-subscribe mechanism implemented by a SEPA broker
			acts as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On receiving a <b>subscribe</b> request:
				<ol>
					<li>It registers the subscription and returns to the
						subscriber the subscription URI (named <i>SPUID</i>, Subscription
						Processing Unit ID)
					</li>
					<li>It performs the <i>SPARQL 1.1 Query</i> [[sparql11-query]]
						specified in the subscription request and notifies the subscriber
						of the results (if any)
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>On receiving an <b>update</b> request:
				<ol>
					<li>It checks all the active subscriptions for results to be
						notified (added, removed or both)</li>
					<li>It sends notifications (if any) to the subscribers</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Clients can also request to unsubscribe by providing the
			corresponding <i>SPUID</i>. The format of requests and notifications
			are expressed according to the <a
				href="http://vaimee.org/TR/sparql11-subscribe.html">SPARQL
				1.1 Subscribe language</a>.
